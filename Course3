Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic programming is a technique used for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. 
It involves solving each subproblem only once and storing the solutions for future use, which can lead to more efficient solutions. 
Classic examples include the knapsack problem and Fibonacci sequence calculation.
